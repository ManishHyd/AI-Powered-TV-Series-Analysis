# AI/NLP TV Series Analysis System

To develop an AI/NLP TV series analysis system, this project uses Hugging Face, Chatbots, Spacy, Gradio, and Python. It collects and scrapes data from the internet and analyses it using various AI and NLP methods, presenting the analysis results in an interactive and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Data Gathering and Scraping**: Uses Scrapy to extract and scrape data from the internet.

To be done
- **Neural Networks and LLMs**: Implement neural networks and large language models (LLMs) for text analysis.
- **Zero-Shot Classification**: Use zero-shot classifiers for theme classification.
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Use Spacy for named entity recognition and character network analysis.
- **Interactive Interface**: Build with Gradio to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface for analyzing TV series.
